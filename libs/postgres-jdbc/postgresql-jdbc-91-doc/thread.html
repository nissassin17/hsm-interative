   A problem with many <acronym class="acronym">JDBC</acronym> drivers is that only
   one thread can use a <code class="classname">Connection</code> at any one
   time --- otherwise a thread could send a query while another one is
   receiving results, and this could cause severe confusion.
  </p><p>
   The <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>™ <acronym class="acronym">JDBC</acronym> driver
   is thread safe.
   Consequently, if your application uses multiple threads then you do
   not have to worry about complex algorithms to ensure that only one thread
   uses the database at a time.
  </p><p>
   If a thread attempts to use the connection while another one is
   using it, it will wait until the other thread has finished its
   current operation.  If the operation is a regular <acronym class="acronym">SQL</acronym>
   statement, then the operation consists of sending the statement and
   retrieving any <code class="classname">ResultSet</code> (in full).  If it
   is a fast-path call (e.g., reading a block
   from a large object) then it consists of
   sending and retrieving the respective data.
  </p><p>
   This is fine for applications and applets but can cause a
   performance problem with servlets.  If you have several threads
   performing queries then each but one will pause.
   To solve this, you are advised to create a pool of connections.
   When ever a thread needs to use the database, it asks a manager
   class for a <code class="classname">Connection</code> object. The manager
   hands a free connection to the thread and marks it as busy. If a
   free connection is not available, it opens one.  Once the thread
   has finished using the connection, it returns it to the manager
   which can then either close it or add it to the pool. The manager
   would also check that the connection is still alive and remove it
   from the pool if it is dead.  The down side of a connection pool is
   that it increases the load on the server because a new session is
   created for each <code class="classname">Connection</code> object.  It is
   up to you and your applications' requirements.
